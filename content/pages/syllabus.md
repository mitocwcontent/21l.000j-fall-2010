Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

Students, scholars, bloggers, reviewers, fans, and book-group members write about literature, but so do authors themselves. Through the ways they engage with their own texts and those of other artists, sampling, remixing, and rethinking texts and genres, writers reflect on and inspire questions about the creative process. We will examine Mary Shelley's reshaping of Milton's _Paradise Lost,_ German fairy tales, tales of scientific discovery, and her husband's poems to make _Frankenstein_ (1818, 1831); Melville's redesign of a travel narrative into a Gothic novella in _Benito Cereno_ (1856); and Alison Bechdel's rewriting of Oscar Wilde's _The Importance of Being Earnest_ (1895) in her graphic novel _Fun Home_ (2006). Showings of film versions of some of these works will allow us to project forward in the remixing process as well.

Course Requirements
-------------------

### Readings

Shelley, M. S. _Frankenstein_. New York, NY: Norton, 1995. ISBN: 9780393964585.

Melville, H. _Benito Cereno_. Boston, MA: Bedford/Saint Martin's, 2006. ISBN: 9780312452421.

Bechdel, Alison. _Fun Home_. Boston, MA: Mariner's Books, 2007. ISBN: 9780618871711.

Wilde, Oscar. _The Importance of Being Earnest, and Other Plays_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780199535972.

### Assignments

Students are expected to complete a minimum of 20 pages of writing, revise a written assignment based on feedback, and develop facility in oral presentations and discussions. The emphasis is on _writing_: the _writing process_, from pre-writing through drafting, revising, and editing; and the _rhetorical dimensions of writing_: the audience for whom one is writing, and the purpose for which one is writing—to argue, inform, persuade, explain, convince, and so on. Students also address major trouble-spots in grammar, mechanics, and style; effective paragraph construction; and proper use and citation of research materials and sources. _In-class workshops_ offer peer feedback on writers' work in progress, allowing students to develop a critical vocabulary and giving writers suggestions for revision. There is no final exam in this class.

### Grading

### Active Participation

### Expectations

*   Written work should be double-spaced, with standard margins and font sizes.

It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work.
